Miscellaneous
-------------

* Odo now has extra install targets for installing different subsystems. For
  example: ``odo[postgres]``, ``odo[bcolz]``, and ``odo[pytables]``. There are
  also three special targets: ``odo[all]``, ``odo[test]`` and ``odo[ci]``.
  ``odo[all]`` installs all of the subsystems available through the various
  non-special targets. ``odo[test]`` installs the dependencies needed to run the
  test suite. Note: you will still need to setup the testing databases
  externally. ``odo[ci]`` is a set of strict (==) requirements  which will be
  used to run the tests on travis and other CI services. This can be used to
  reproduce the test environment that the automated tests ran in (:issue:`496`).

* We now run the CI on a frozen set of dependencies to make it easier to
  reproduce a testing environment. One downside of this is that we will need to
  manually keep our packages up to date; however, if someone wants to own a
  package update we will be very willing to help support that (:issue:`496`).
